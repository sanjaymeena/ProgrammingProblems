Lithium zirconates have attracted researchers’ interests because they can also be used as solid sorbents for CO2 capture. The structural, electronic, and phonon properties of Li2ZrO3, Li6Zr2O7, and monoclinic phase ZrO2 are investigated by the density-functional theory and phonon dynamics. Their electrochemical properties and their thermodynamics of CO2 absorption/desorption are analyzed. The calculated results show that their optimized structures and calculated bulk moduli as well as cohesive energies are in good agreement with experimental measurements. The calculated band gaps are 3.90 eV (indirect), 3.98 eV (direct), and 3.76 eV (direct) for Li2ZrO3, Li6Zr2O7, and ZrO2, respectively. The calculated Li intercalation voltage and energy densities of Li2ZrO3 are higher than that of Li6Zr2O7, which indicates that as a cathode material Li2ZrO3 is better than Li6Zr2O7. The calculated phonon dispersions and density of states show that there is one soft mode in Li2ZrO3 and two soft modes in Li6Zr2O7. From the calculated thermodynamic properties of these two lithium zirconates reacting with CO2, we found that the performance of Li2ZrO3 as a CO2 sorbent is better than that of Li6Zr2O7. In the first half cycle, sorbents absorbing CO2 to form lithium carbonate, Li6Zr2O7 performs better than Li2ZrO3 because the former releases more heat of reaction and has a lower Gibbs free energy and a higher CO2 capture capacity. However, during the second half cycle, regenerating sorbent from carbonate and zirconia to release CO2, the main product is the thermodynamically favorable Li2ZrO3 rather than forming Li6Zr2O7.
As solid electrolytes, lithium salts (Li4SiO4, Li2ZrO3, etc.) are widely used in high-energy lithium secondary batteries since they are both ionic conductors and of the ternary oxides that are thermodynamically stable against Li. Lithium meta-zirconate (Li2ZrO3) is also one of the best candidate blanket materials for tritium breeding components in the deuterium-tritium fusion reactor. Moreover, lithium zirconates are good piezoelectric ceramics . 9 Nowadays, the burning of fossil fuels is the main energy source for the world economy. One consequence of the use of these carbon based fuels is the emission of huge quantities of CO2 into the atmosphere creating environmental problems such as global climate warming. 10–12 One approach to solving such environmental problems is to capture and sequester the CO2.4,13 Experimental investigations conducted in the past few decades found a new application that lithium zirconates are good candidates of solid sorbents for CO2 capture in terms of large CO2 sorption capacity, infinite CO2/N2 or CO2/H2 selectivity, good reversibility, and high operating temperature. Nakagawa and Ohashi 15,16 first reported that lithium zirconate powder reacts immediately with ambient CO2 in the temperature range of 450–550 °C and the products decompose reversibly to lithium zirconate and CO2 at temperatures above 650 °C. Ida et al.22,23 pointed out that the rate of the CO2 sorption on pure zirconate is controlled by the diffusion of CO2 in the solid lithium carbonate shell, whereas Xiong et al.30 revealed that it is the size of the aggregate of Li2ZrO3 that controls the CO2 sorption rate. A lithium zirconate based membrane has a high separation factor of 4.9 between CO2 and CH4 gas molecules at 600 °C. Recent experimental results also indicated that doping or mixing lithium zirconates with other alkali salts could improve the CO2 sorption. Pfeiffer et al.4 reported that hexa-lithium zirconate (Li6Zr2O7) absorbed four times more CO2 than Li2ZrO3, and its CO2 sorption rate is faster than Li2ZrO3 at short times, but they became similar after long times. Ochoa-Fernandez et al.24,33 showed that the nanocrystalline tetragonal Li2ZrO3 has superior CO2 capture and regeneration properties when compared to monoclinic Li2ZrO3 prepared by solid-state synthesis. Their results demonstrated that both the capture rate and capacity of lithium zirconate depend considerably on the ratio of Li2O to ZrO2, and the enhanced capture rates were observed when a deficiency of Li2O is introduced, where excess ZrO2 as a dispersant introduces more reactive boundaries . 34 Recently, they also investigated the effects of steam addition to the stability of Li2ZrO3 in the CO2 capture process and showed that while the presence of steam enhances the capture and regeneration rates, there is a large decay in the absorption capacity when compared with dry capture condition. By means of thermodynamics calculation and experimental measurements, Nakagawa and Ohashi 16 pointed out that the change from Li2ZrO3 to ZrO2 depends not only on temperature and CO2 partial pressure but also on the presence of molten carbonates (e.g., alkali carbonates with a molar ratio of Li:K=62:38). Very recently, Iwan et al.36 explored the equilibrium and kinetics of CO2 reacting with Li2ZrO3 and found that at high temperatures its reaction rate is considerably fast. They also observed relatively slow reaction rates at PCO2<0.4 bar, possibly due to mass transfer limitations. The mechanisms of these reversible reactions are not clear. Essaki et al.18 proposed a reaction model for lithium zirconate absorption of CO2 at room temperature. The CO2 reacts with Li2O in the Li2ZrO3 to form Li2CO3. If H2O is present, the CO2 and Li2O first will hydrolyze before forming Li2CO3. However, they did not explain how the Li2O migrated out of Li2ZrO3 bulk structure, nor did they describe the ensuing changes to the Li2ZrO3 bulk structure. Ida et al.22,23 also proposed a similar double shell model to describe the CO2 sorption mechanism on Li2ZrO3 from a qualitative point of view. They found that in order to continue to form Li2CO3, the lithium has to migrate and cross the Li2CO3 shell. The rate of the CO2 absorption is controlled by the diffusion of CO2 into the solid lithium carbonate shell 22,23 and the aggregate size with the Li2ZrO3 bulk. Even with these shells on the CO2 absorption process, it was not clearly known as to how the Li2ZrO3 structure changes to ZrO2 and how the Li2O comes out of Li2ZrO3 structure to react with the CO2. In comparison to the previously cited extensive experimental studies on lithium zirconates and related materials, in the literature, there are few theoretical studies, particularly on the electronic structure and lattice dynamics of these lithium zirconates. Using pseudohomogeneous and heterogeneous models, Rusten et al.27 simulated a fixed-bed reactor for the production of hydrogen via sorption-enhanced steam methane reforming using Li2ZrO3 as a CO2-acceptor. Pfeiffer and Bosch 4 used molecular dynamics to investigate the thermal stability and CO2 absorption of Li6Zr2O7. Their results indicated that the best temperature for CO2 absorption on Li6Zr2O7 is 550 °C and that the Li6Zr2O7 does not regenerate after the CO2 desorption, but instead decomposes into Li2ZrO3. In contrast to lithium zirconates, in the literature, the electronic structural properties of zirconia have been extensively investigated. Our previous results of Li2O capturing CO2 showed that Li2O is good at absorbing CO2, but the reverse reaction to release CO2 can occur only at very low pressure and very high temperature. In this study, we first employ first-principles density-functional method to investigate the electronic structural and the lattice dynamical phonon properties of Li2ZrO3 and Li6Zr2O7 extensively, then analyze in detail the properties of CO2 absorption/desorption based on the energetic and thermal dynamical results. The remainder of this report is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we briefly describe the theoretical method we employed. In Sec. III, we present the electronic and phonon results for lithium zirconates and compare them with other available data. We then analyze their electrochemical properties by calculating the open circuit voltage and energy densities. Subsequently, we analyze their capabilities for CO2 capture by calculating the chemical potential change for the capture reactions under different external pressures and temperatures. In Sec. IV, we summarize our conclusions.
THEORETICAL
 The calculations performed in this work are based on first-principles density-functional theory (DFT) with plane-wave basis sets and the pseudopotential to describe the electron-ion interactions. The Vienna ab initio simulation package 41,42 was employed in this study to calculate the electronic structures of the lithium zirconates and zirconia materials. In this study, all calculations have been done using the projector augmented wave pseudopotentials and the PW91 exchange-correlation functional. This computational level was shown to provide an accurate description of oxide systems . 43 Plane wave basis sets were used with a cutoff energy of 500 eV and a kinetic energy cutoff for augmentation charges of 605.4 eV. The k-point sampling grids of n1×n2×n3, obtained using the Monkhorst–Pack method ,44 were used for these bulk calculations, where n1, n2, and n3 were determined consistent to a spacing of about 0.028 Å−1 along the axes of the reciprocal unit cells. The corresponding k-point sets that we used in our calculations were 7×4×7 for Li2ZrO3, 4×6×4 for Li6Zr2O7, and 8×8×8 for ZrO2, respectively. The valence electrons contain the s and p orbitals of Li and O atoms, and the s, p, and d orbitals of Zr. During the calculations, all atoms in the cell as well as the lattice dimensions and angles were relaxed to the equilibrium configurations. For band structure and phonon dispersion calculations, the symbols and coordinates of the high symmetrical points in the first Brillouin zone of the crystals are taken from Bradley and Cracknell’s definitions . 45 When applying these two lithium zirconates as solid CO2 absorbents, we have the following reactions:Li2ZrO3+CO2↔T,PLi2CO3+ZrO2  (a),Li6Zr2O7+3CO2↔T,P3Li2CO3+2ZrO2  (b),Li6Zr2O7+2CO2↔T,P2Li2CO3+2ZrO2+Li2ZrO3  (c),Li6Zr2O7+CO2↔T,PLi2CO3+2Li2ZrO3  (d). Obviously, the product Li2ZrO3 from reactions (c) and (d) can further absorb CO2 by reaction (a) and finally become reaction (b). Assuming the difference between the chemical potential of solid phases (Li2ZrO3, Li6Zr2O7, ZrO2, and Li2CO3) can be approximated by the differences in their electronic energies (ΔEDFT) and their entropies (ΔSharm) and harmonic free energies (ΔFharm), we can obtain the temperature and pressure dependent chemical potential (Δμ) for these reactions,40, 46–49Δμ(T,P)=Δμ0(T)−nRT ln(PCO2/P0),withΔμ0(T)=ΔEDFT+ΔEZP+ΔFharm(T)−TΔSharm(T)−GCO2(T),where ΔEZP is the zero-point energy difference between the reactants and products and can be obtained directly from phonon calculations. n in Eq. (1) is the number of moles of absorbed CO2 in reactions (a)–(d). P0 is the standard state reference pressure of 1 bar. The free energy of CO2 (GCO2) can be obtained by standard statistical mechanics,50GCO2(T)≈72RT+∑i=14Nahνiehνi/kT−1−TSCO2(T),where Na is the Avogadro constant. The vibrational frequencies (νi) of CO2 molecule are 673 cm−1(πu), 1354 cm−1(σg+), and 2397 cm−1(σu+),51 from which the zero-point energy of CO2 molecule is obtained with the value of 0.316 eV. The entropy of CO2 [SCO2(T) in J/mol] can be accurately evaluated using the Shomate equation,52SCO2(T)=A∗ ln(t)+B∗t+C∗t22+D∗t33+E2∗t2+G,where t=T/1000, and A, B, C, D, E, and G are parameters. For CO2, in the temperature (T) range of 298–1200 K, their values are 24.997 35, 55.186 96, −33.691 37, 7.948 387, −0.136 638, and 228.2431, respectively. The enthalpy change for the reactions (a)–(d), ΔHcal(T), can be derived from above equations asΔHcal(T)=Δμ0(T)+T[nSCO2(T)+ΔSharm(T)].
When considering the phase stability and transitions and the thermodynamics of crystalline materials, their fundamental properties are the phonon frequencies. The approaches of ab initio calculations fall into two classes: the linear response method ,53,54 in which the dynamical matrix is expressed in terms of the inverse dielectric matrix describing the response of the valence electron density to a periodic lattice perturbation, and the direct method, 55–57 in which the forces are calculated via the Hellmann–Feynman theorem. Here, in this paper, we employ the PHONON software package 58 in which the direct method is applied following the formula derived by Parlinski et al.57 to combine ab initio DFT with phonon calculations. Similar to our previous approach ,40,59 the phonon dispersion and the thermodynamic properties (zero-point energy, free energy change, entropy change, etc.) can be carried out for each crystal. In turn, the zero-point energy change (ΔEZP) and the phonon free energy change [ΔFharm(T) in Eq. (2)] are obtained for the CO2 capture reactions (a)–(d). In the phonon calculations, a 2×2×2 supercell is created for ZrO2 and Li2ZrO3 from their optimized unit cells that are calculated through DFT. In order to make the shape of the supercell close to cubic and to take into account the proper size of the cell, for Li6Zr2O7, a 1×2×1 supercell, which contains eight formula units of Li6Zr2O7, is used for its phonon property calculations. The displacement of 0.03 Å of nonequivalent atoms is generated. Then for the supercell, the DFT calculations were performed again to obtain the force on each atom due to the displacements. These forces are carried back to the PHONON package 58 to calculate the phonon dispersions and density of states. The partition function can be carried out with the phonon dispersions and densities of states. With them, their thermodynamic properties, such as internal energy, free energy, entropy, heat capacity, etc., can be evaluated under different temperature and pressure, which are used in Eq. (1) to calculate the chemical potentials for the reactions (a)–(d).
Structural optimization and bulk 
 Lithium zirconates can be synthesized from Li2CO3 and ZrO2 with different ratios . 1,2, 60–62 Recently, Yin et al.61 reported that substituting Li2CO3 with LiOH can obtain Li2ZrO3 and Li6Zr2O7, and furthermore substituting ZrO2 with Zr(NO3)4⋅5H2O can obtain Li6Zr2O7 with decreased synthesis time. Although its tetragonal metastable phase could exist ,62 lithium meta-zirconate (Li2ZrO3) usually is in a monoclinic structure with space group C2/c (No. 15). At low temperature (T=82 K), its crystal constants are a=5.4089 Å, b=9.0309 Å, c=5.4144 Å, and β=112.498°, in which Zr is located at site (0,0.0919,14), Li occupies sites (0,0.4195,14) and (0,0.7330,14), and O atoms are located at sites (14,14,12) and (0.2578, 0.4779, 0.4195). As shown by Heiba and El-Sayed ,2 there were large anisotropic changes in its lattice parameters as a function of temperature, slight changes in the fractional coordinates of different atoms, and anisotropic changes in the interatomic distances between the different cations. Hexa-lithium zirconate (Li6Zr2O7) also has monoclinic structure with space group C2/c (No. 15). By comparing the structure of Li2ZrO3 with that of Li6Zr2O7, it can be seen that both of them are of the NaCl type. However, the distributions of the cations are different in these two phases and therefore they can not be considered isostructural. As shown in Fig. 1, in Li2ZrO3 all cations have octahedral coordination and its structure has to be considered as close packed, whereas the structure of Li6Zr2O7 is more open, and both Li+ and O2− ions in Li6Zr2O7 may have higher mobility that leads to higher ionic conductivity than Li2ZrO3 does. Although zirconia (ZrO2) can be presented in several different crystal structures under different temperatures and pressures ,63 at ambient condition it presents a monoclinic structure with space group P21/c (No. 14). Here, for the purpose of investigating the thermodynamic properties of the CO2 capture reactions, we only deal with its ambient phase. The crystal structures of these two zirconates and most stable monoclinic ZrO2 phase are shown in Fig. 1. Their experimental crystal structural constants as well as our optimized structural constants are summarized in Table I. From Fig. 1, it can be seen that there are 4 f.u. in each unit cell. In Li6Zr2O7, each Zr atom coordinated with six O and Li atoms is located close to O. The Zr layered is located along (111¯) direction (not exactly parallel to). On each layer, Zr is planar coordinated with four O, whereas between each layer, Zr is bonded with O. Similar layered structures can also be seen in the structure of Li2ZrO3, but on each Zr layer, half of the Zr is distorted above the plane and half of the Zr is below the plane. From Table I, one can see that the deviations of our optimized structures of Li2ZrO3 and Li6Zr2O7 from the corresponding experimental measurements are less than 1%. In order to explore the bulk properties of lithium zirconates, we calculate their total energies versus the changes of cell volume. From them, we can obtain the relationship between energy and volume or pressure by fitting the equation of state. The most popular and well widely used equation of state is the Birch–Murnaghan equation of state (E-V),65,66E(V)=E+09×B0V016{[(V0V)2/3−1]3×B0′+[(V0V)2/3−1]2×[6−4×(V0V)2/3]}.
 By fitting the calculated data of E-V into Eq. (6), the bulk properties of solids can be obtained. The fitted results of these lithium zirconates and zirconia are listed in Table II. The bulk modulus B is defined as B=B0+B′0×P in this scheme, where P is the pressure and here is set to 1 atm. The cohesive energy (EC) is calculated by subtracting the total bulk energy (E0 in Table II) from the sum of total energies of the related atoms (such as Li, Zr, O) using the same level calculations (in our case, we get ELi=−0.044 03 eV, EZr=−1.298 28 eV, and EO=−1.491 35 eV). The calculated EC as well as other values from references are listed in Table II. From Table II, one can see that the calculated bulk modulus of ZrO2 (181.4 GPa) is close to those fitted and experimental measured values made by Bouvier et al.63 and Dewhurst et al. The calculated cohesive energy of monoclinic ZrO2 (−24.447 eV) is between the experimental value of −22.85 eV and the local density approximation calculated result of −26.24 eV. We also made the DFT calculations for other five phases of ZrO2 (space group numbers: 29, 61, 62, 137, and 225). Our results show that the monoclinic phase has the lowest energy, which is consistent with the experimental results that the monoclinic phase is most stable under ambient conditions and also consistent with Öztürk and Durandurdu’s recent calculated results . 67 However, in the report of Lowther et al.,38 the relative energy of monoclinic ZrO2 is lower than two cubic phases (Nos. 137 and 225) but about 0. 02–0.033 eV/atom higher than other three phases (Nos. 29, 61, and 62). Therefore, in our following phonon and CO2 capture calculations, only the monoclinic phase of ZrO2 is considered. Comparing Li2ZrO3 with Li6Zr2O7, one can see from Table II that their bulk moduli are close to each other, but Li6Zr2O7 has much higher cohesive energy than Li2ZrO3.
Electronic structural 
 The calculated band structures of lithium zirconates (Li2ZrO3, Li6Zr2O7) and monoclinic ZrO2 are shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen that the band structures of these three materials have some similarities. They have two valence bands (VBs) and their shapes look similar to each other. Their second VBs are located below −15 eV while their first VBs are just below the Fermi energy. The calculated band gap of Li2ZrO3 is an indirect one, located between Γ and Z high-symmetric points with the value of 3.90 eV, while the calculated band gaps of Li6Zr2O7 and ZrO2 are direct with the values of 3.98 and 3.76 eV, as shown in Figs. 2(b) and 2(c), respectively. Obviously, the calculated values of their band gaps are close to each other. However, as described in our previous work ,40,43 the DFT calculation underestimated the excited-state energy. The calculated band gaps are usually smaller than the experimental measurements, although currently there is no experimental value available for comparison. As summarized in Table III, the band widths of the first and second VBs for Li6Zr2O7 and Li2ZrO3 have only about 0.15 eV difference, while ZrO2 has a larger first valence band width. Figure 3 shows the calculated total density of states and their corresponding atom partial density of states for Li2ZrO3, Li6Zr2O7, and monoclinic ZrO2. As demonstrated in Fig. 3, the s orbital of O contributes to the lower second VBs of Li2ZrO3, Li6Zr2O7, and ZrO2, while its p orbitals are mainly contributed to their first VBs. In all three cases, all the s, p, and d orbitals of Zr contribute to both VBs, but its d orbitals have higher contributions than its s and p orbitals. From Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), it can be seen that when compared with its s orbital, the p orbital of Li has a larger contribution to the upper portion of the first VB in both Li2ZrO3 and Li6Zr2O7. From Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), one can see that in both Li2ZrO3 and Li6Zr2O7, each Zr atom is coordinated with six O atoms and around each O atom is bonded to two Zr atoms. The distances between Zr and O in Li2ZrO3 are 2. 07–2.21 Å and in Li6Zr2O7 are 2. 05–2.15 Å. The differences between these two structures are mainly caused by the distributions of Li atoms. Their structure similarities give similar band structures.
Electrochemical properties of lithium
 Lithium zirconates could be used as cathode materials. Their electrochemical properties can be derived directly from the difference in total energies before and after lithium intercalation. This procedure can improve the accuracy through the cancellation of errors . 68 Typically, the cathode discharge assumes the half-cell reaction versus Li/Li+, 68–70LinZrmOk+xLi++xe−→Lin+xZrmOk  (e). The open circuit voltage (OCV) for an intercalation reaction involving x Li+ ions can be evaluated from the energy difference if volume and entropy effects are neglected,68OCV≈E(LinZrmOk)+xE(Li_metal)−E(Lin+xZrmOk)xF,where F is the Faraday constant. The energy density (EΩ in Wh/l) and the specific energy (Em in Wh/kg) for battery reaction are given byEΩ=−ΔEΩ,Em=−ΔEm,where ΔE is the energy difference between the reactant (LinZrmOk) and product (Lin+xZrmOk), Ω is the mean volume of 1 f.u. of reactant and 1 f.u. of product in the discharge reaction (e), and m is the mean mass of 1 f.u. of reactant and 1 f.u. of product. Using the same calculating procedure, for Li metal, the calculated E(Li_metal)=−1.8860 eV/atom. From Table I, it can be seen that when removing one Li from Li2ZrO3 there are two possibilities corresponding to upper and lower layers of Li, as shown in Fig. 1(a). For the case of Li6Zr2O7, as shown in Table I and Fig. 1(b), it contains three different groups of Li and each group has two Li. In order to keep the crystal symmetry as high as possible, instead of removing one Li, we remove two Li atoms from Li6Zr2O7 creating three possible configurations of Li4Zr2O7. Therefore, in this work, the OCVs are calculated for Li6Zr2O7 with x=2 and for Li2ZrO3 with x=1 in Eq. (7), respectively. The optimized lattice parameters for the reduced lithium zirconates are listed in Table IV. Cases A–C correspond to removing different types of Li atoms (shown in Table I) one by one. Comparing Table IV with Table I, one can see that removing different sets of Li results in different structures and electrochemical properties due to the different environments of these Li sets in the crystal structures, as shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). Interestingly, except for case B of LiZrO3, after removing one set of Li, the crystal structures are expanded because of more repulsions caused by less Li and almost all atoms in the crystal rearranged to a new equilibrium. The calculated OCV, energy density (EΩ), and the specific energy (Em) of their lithium intercalation reactions for Li2ZrO3 and Li6Zr2O7 are also summarized in Table IV. Obviously, from Eqs. (7) and (9), if the cell energy of the reduced crystal is lower, its OCV and Em should be higher. However, their energy density (EΩ) could be lower because it also depends on the cell volume, as shown in Eq. (8). The difference of the calculated OCV between two cases of Li2ZrO3/LiZrO3 is 0.01 V, while in the case of Li6Zr2O7/Li4Zr2O7 the difference is about 0.3 V. Comparing Li2ZrO3 with Li6Zr2O7, one can see that the Li2ZrO3 has higher OCV, energy density, and specific energy, which means that as a cathode material Li2ZrO3 is better than Li6Zr2O7.
Dynamical phonon 
 As shown in Table I for each solid, there are 4 f.u. (Z=4) in each unit cell. However, the primitive cells of Li2ZrO3 and Li6Zr2O7 only contain 2 f.u. while the primitive cell of monoclinic ZrO2 still contains 4 f.u. Therefore, there are 90 phonon modes in Li6Zr2O7 and 36 phonon modes in Li2ZrO3 and ZrO2. The calculated phonon dispersions of lithium zirconates (Li2ZrO3, Li6Zr2O7) and monoclinic phase of ZrO2 are shown in Figs. 4(a)–4(c), respectively. In Table V, we summarize our calculated phonon frequencies of these three solids together with the corresponding irreducible representations. Unfortunately, in the literature we did not find any experimental or theoretical data to compare with. Obviously, all of the vibrational modes are nondegenerate (Au, Ag, Bu, and Bg) because their crystal point groups are quite low with C2h, and half of them are Raman active and the other half infrared active, as shown in Table V. It can be seen from Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) that along the wave-vector there are some soft modes in these two lithium zirconates. In the case of Li2ZrO3 [Fig. 4(a)], one soft mode belonging to acoustical branch is around the high-symmetric points Z and L. In the dispersion curve of Li6Zr2O7, as shown in Fig. 4(b), there are two soft modes along the wave-vectors V-Γ and Z-Γ. In the case of monoclinic ZrO2, as shown in Fig. 4(c), no obvious soft mode was found. However, using a similar approach, Sternik and Parlinski 71 found a soft model branch in the cubic phase of ZrO2 and considered it as an ensemble of independent anharmonic oscillators of the parabola-Gaussian or of the 2-4 polynomial forms. From Fig. 4, one can see that in all three solids the lowest three modes [one longitudinal (LA) Au and two transverse (TA) Bu] at Γ point (which frequencies are very close to zero, as shown in Table V) represent the motion of mass center and are infrared active. As we know during phonon dispersion calculations, the translational-rotational invariance conditions for these solids are not fulfilled because the PHONON package does not know which independent parameters of the force constants should be renormalized in order to obey the translational-rotational invariance. Consequently, the acoustic phonon modes may not begin at the zero frequency at the center of the Brillouin zone. Therefore, the calculated frequencies at Γ points, as shown in Fig. 4 and Table V, are not exactly zero, but very close to ≤0.2 cm−1 (as shown in Table V). The calculated phonon density of states of lithium zirconates and zirconia is shown in Fig. 5. As one can see that there are some similarities among these three compounds, their frequencies span up to 24 THz, and the number of high frequency modes is small and forming a separate band, as shown in Fig. 4. From the partial density of states of each displaced atom and the polarization vector analysis (not show in the figure), overall, it can be found that the higher frequency region (>17 THz in Fig. 5) comes from the O displacements while the lower frequency region (<6 THz in Fig. 5) comes from the Zr displacements. Among the middle range ( 6–17 THz), the vibrational frequencies are from all types of atoms. Among them, Zr vibrations mainly contribute to the low portion of this range (<10 THz). As shown in Fig. 1 and Table I, each element may have more than one type with different coordination environments in the crystal. Therefore, their phonon dispersion behaviors are also different. The soft mode in Li2ZrO3 is mainly from Zr displacements with one type of Li displacements, while the soft modes in Li6Zr2O7 are mainly from Zr displacements with a small contribution from O vibration. The calculated phonon free energy of each solid versus temperature is shown in Fig. 6(a), from which the zero-point energies can be obtained and are listed in Table III. In order to explore their properties of capturing CO2, the thermodynamic properties of Li2ZrO3 are also shown in the same figure. As one can see, the zero-point energies of these solids are significant and must be included into predicting their thermodynamic properties [Eq. (2)]. From Fig. 6(a), one can see that at low-temperature Li6Zr2O7 has higher free energy compared with Li2ZrO3. However, when the temperature is increased, its free energy decreased rapidly. Figure 6(b) shows the calculated entropies of these solids versus the temperatures. Obviously, at 0 K, their entropies are zero and increase with increasing temperature. As shown in Table III, similar to other systems of larger number of solids ,49 our calculated entropies of these three solids at room temperature are quite close to the experimental measured values, which indicate that our theoretical approach can achieve reasonable results and therefore can be used to evaluate other unknown systems. By including these free energies and entropies at different temperatures into Eqs. (1) and (5), the thermodynamic properties of the reactions of lithium zirconates capturing CO2 can be evaluated, as described in Sec. III E.
Capabilities of lithium zirconates capture 
 From experimental investigations, lithium zirconates are good candidates of solid sorbents for CO2 capture in terms of large CO2 sorption capacity, infinite CO2/N2 or CO2/H2 selectivity, good reversibility, and high operating temperature. According to Eq. (5), the calculated heat of reaction (enthalpy change) for reactions (a)–(d) versus the temperatures is plotted in Fig. 7(a) and also summarized in Table VI. For comparison, the available experimental data for the reaction of Li2ZrO3 capturing CO2 from HSC-Chemistry database 72 are also shown in Fig. 7(a). For the reaction of Li2ZrO3 capture CO2, as seen in Fig. 7(a), the data from HSC-Chemistry database have two discontinuities at temperatures of 623 and 683 K, which correspond to the solid-solid phase transitions of the product Li2CO3 at those temperatures . 72 However, in the literature, there is no crystal structure available for those high-T solid phases of Li2CO3. Therefore, as an approximation, we used the structure of its low-T phase (<623 K) to represent its structure in high-T range. The temperature effects were partially taken into account by phonon dynamics at different temperature without specific phase transition. That is why in Fig. 7(a), the simulated enthalpy of the Li2ZrO3 capture CO2 reaction does not have discontinuity compared to the HSC data. As one can see from Fig. 7(a), overall our calculated heat of reaction for Li2ZrO3 is close to the data from HSC-Chemistry database, especially in the temperature range of 600–900 K, which is the temperature range for CO2 capture. Since there are no experimental data available for Li6Zr2O7, in Fig. 7(a) only our calculated reaction heats of Li6Zr2O7 capturing CO2 [reaction (b)–(d)] are plotted. From them, one can see that Li6Zr2O7 absorbs CO2 to form lithium carbonate and lithium meta-zirconate (Li2ZrO3), and the Li2ZrO3 can further absorb CO2 to dissociate to most stable ZrO2. According to Eq. (1), for the reactions of lithium zirconates capturing CO2, we can explore the relationship among the chemical potential [Δμ(T,P)], the temperature, and the CO2 pressure (PCO2). This kind of relationship for reactions (a)–(d) is shown in Fig. 7(b). The line in Fig. 7(b) indicates that for each reaction, the Δμ(T,P) is approaching zero. Around the line is a good region for the absorption and desorption because of the minimum energy costs at the given temperature and pressure. Above the line, the solid (Li2ZrO3, Li6Zr2O7) is favorable to absorb CO2 and to form Li2CO3, while below the line the Li2CO3 is favorable to release CO2 and regenerate lithium zirconate solids back. As described above and shown in Fig. 7, all of these reactions are thermodynamically favorable over a quite wide range of temperatures (<900 K) and PCO2, which means that under this temperature range the CO2 is thermodynamically favored by lithium zirconates. But as a CO2 solid sorbent, the sorbent should not only be easy to absorb the CO2 in the first half cycle but also easy to release the CO2 from products (Li2CO3 and ZrO2, for example) in the second half cycle. The operating conditions for absorption/desorption processes are depending on the pre- and postcombustion technologies. Under precombustion conditions, after water-gas shifting, the gas stream mainly contains CO2, H2O, and H2. The partial CO2 pressure is around 20–25 bar and the temperature is around 673–723 K. To minimize the energy consumption, the ideal sorbents should work at these pressure and temperature ranges to separate CO2 from H2. This temperature, denoted T1, is listed in Table VI, and is the temperature above which the lithium zirconates cannot absorb CO2 anymore and will start to release CO2. This indicates that during the first half cycle to capture CO2, the operating temperature should be lower than T1, whereas the operating temperature may be higher than T1 (depending on the desired obtained CO2 pressure) during the second half cycle of sorbents regeneration to release CO2. For postcombustion conditions, the gas stream mainly contains CO2 and N2, the partial pressure of CO2 is around 0. 1–0.2 bar, and the temperature range is quite different. However, the low-temperature capture is desired. The DOE programmatic goal for postcombustion CO2 capture is to capture at least 90% CO2 with the cost in electricity no more than 35%, whereas in the case of precombustion CO2 capture, the goal is to capture at least 90% CO2 with the cost in electricity no more than 10%. The turnover temperatures (denoted as T2) for postcombustion capture by these two lithium zirconates are also listed in Table VI. From Table VI and Fig. 7(b), one can see that these two lithium zirconates capture CO2 up to higher temperatures (T1>1000 K) compared with desired precombustion condition ( 673–723 K). Therefore, they are not good sorbents for capturing CO2 in precombustion technology. However, they could be used for high-temperature postcombustion CO2 capture with T2=780 and 880 K for Li2ZrO3 and Li6Zr2O7, respectively, as experimental results indicate that Li2ZrO3 reacts immediately with ambient CO2 (PCO2=1 bar) in the range of 723–823 K and products react and return reversibly to lithium zirconate at temperatures above 873 K. From Fig. 7(b), one can see that during the first half cycle of absorbing CO2, the Li6Zr2O7 can be fully converted into ZrO2 and Li2CO3 because the partial reactions [(c) and (d)] do not gain any energetic advantage. Interestingly, during the second half cycle of capturing, when the Li2CO3 and the ZrO2 react with each other to release CO2 and regenerate the sorbent back, only Li2ZrO3 can be regenerated. As shown in Fig. 7(b), the reaction curve of Li2ZrO3 capturing CO2 is always higher than the other three curves of Li6Zr2O7 reacting with CO2. Therefore, the regeneration first forms Li2ZrO3, not Li6Zr2O7. The Li6Zr2O7 can only be formed either at low CO2 pressure (T fixed) or at high temperature (PCO2 fixed) through Li2ZrO3 further reacting with Li2CO3 and ZrO2. In order words, no matter what the initial solid is Li2ZrO3 or Li6Zr2O7, after first sorption/desorption cycle, the following cycle is only for the reaction Li2ZrO3+CO2=Li2CO3+ZrO2 and there is no Li6Zr2O7 left in the system. This is in good agreement with the experimental findings as Pfeiffer et al.4 reported that the hexa-lithium zirconate (Li6Zr2O7) absorbed four times more CO2 than Li2ZrO3, and its CO2 sorption rate is faster than Li2ZrO3 at short times, but after long times, their capture behaviors became similar. This result indicates that there is no advantage to use Li6Zr2O7 over Li2ZrO3 as CO2 sorbent because they have the same functionality after the first cycle. From Table VI and Fig. 7(b), one can see that the reverse reaction is not just to dissociate Li2CO3 but also to regenerate Li2ZrO3 from Li2O by reacting with ZrO2, which involves net energy gain, and lay down the conditions for Δμ>0 compared with the case of Li2O. In other words, the presence of ZrO2 can destabilize the stable phase of Li2CO3 and make the reverse reaction to release CO2 less energy required.40
The electronic structural and phonon properties of Li2ZrO3, Li6Zr2O7, and monoclinic phase ZrO2 are investigated by the density-functional theory and phonon dynamics. Their electrochemical properties and the thermodynamic properties of CO2 absorption/desorption are analyzed. The optimized structures and calculated bulk modulus and cohesive energy are in good agreement with experimental measurements. The calculated band gaps are 3.90 eV (indirect), 3.98 eV (direct), and 3.76 eV (direct) for Li2ZrO3, Li6Zr2O7, and ZrO2, respectively. The s orbital of O contributes to the lower second VBs of Li2ZrO3, Li6Zr2O7, and ZrO2, while its p orbitals mainly contribute to their first VBs. In all three cases, all the s, p, and d orbitals of Zr contribute to both VBs, but its d orbitals have higher contributions than its s and p orbitals. In both Li2ZrO3 and Li6Zr2O7, comparing with its s orbital, the p orbital of Li has a larger contribution to the upper portion of their first VBs. By assuming half-cell reaction versus Li/Li+, the calculated Li intercalation open circuit voltages and energy densities of Li2ZrO3 are higher than that of Li6Zr2O7, which indicate that as a cathode material Li2ZrO3 is better than Li6Zr2O7. The phonon dispersions and phonon density of states for Li2ZrO3 and Li6Zr2O7 were calculated by the direct method. For Li2ZrO3, around the high-symmetric points Z and L, there is one soft mode that originates mainly from displacing Zr atoms and displacing one type of Li atoms. In Li6Zr2O7, among the high-symmetric point intervals V-Γ and Z-Γ, there are two soft modes which are mainly from Zr displacements with a small contribution from O vibration. Based on the phonon dispersion, the phonon free energy, the internal energy, and the entropy of these solids were evaluated within the harmonic approximation and have been used to analyze the chemical potentials of the reactions of CO2 capture by these two lithium zirconates. From the calculated thermodynamical properties of these two lithium zirconates reacting with CO2, we found that overall the performances of Li2ZrO3 capturing CO2 are better than that of Li6Zr2O7. In the first half cycle for the sorbent to absorb CO2 to form lithium carbonate, Li6Zr2O7 is better than Li2ZrO3 because the former reaction releases more heat of reaction and has a lower Gibbs free energy and a higher CO2 capture capacity. However, during the second half cycle to regenerate the sorbent from carbonate and zirconia and to release CO2, instead of forming Li6Zr2O7, the main product is the thermodynamically favorable Li2ZrO3. Therefore, compared with Li2ZrO3, there is no advantage for using Li6Zr2O7 as CO2 sorbent.
