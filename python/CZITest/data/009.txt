The crystal structures, elastic and anisotropic properties of CH3NH3BX3 (B = Sn, Pb; X = Br, I) compounds as solar cell absorber layers are investigated by the first-principles calculations. The type and strength of chemical bond B-X are found to determine the elastic properties. B-X bonds and the organic cations are therefore crucial to the functionalities of such absorbers. The bulk, shear, Young's modulus ranges from 12 to 30 GPa, 3 to 12 GPa, and 15 to 37 GPa, respectively. Moreover, the interaction among organic and inorganic ions would have negligible effect for elastic properties. The B/G and Poisson's ratio show it would have a good ductile ability for extensive deformation as a flexible/stretchable layer on the polymer substrate. The main reason is attributed to the low shear modulus of such perovskites. The anisotropic indices AU, AB AG, A1, A2, and A3 show ABX3 perovskite have very strong anisotropy derived from the elastic constants, chemical bonds, and symmetry.
The hybrid organic-inorganic halide perovskite materials such as CH3NH3BX3 (B = Sn, Pb; X = Br, I) as light harvesters in solid state sensitized solar cells has led reports of impressive efficiency values of up to 16%. Kazim ,8 Snaith ,9 Park,10 and Kim et al.11 have discussed interplay of the physical and electronic structure of lead halide perovskites with respect to their photovoltaic applications. Methylammounium triiodideplumbate and related compounds, CH3NH3BX3 (B = Sn, Pb; X = Br, I) take a structural phase transition, cubic, tetragonal, and orthorhombic depending on the temperature. Kawamura et al. Mashiyama et al. Baikie et al. Borriello et al. Chiarella et al. Feng and Xiao,18 Frost et al.,19 and Brivio et al.20 have identified the crystal structure of CH3NH3BX3 (MAB3) by experiments and density of functional theory (DFT) calculation. The electronic and optical properties of hybrid perovskites are calculated by first-principles, 21–24 which show that they have good photon absorption ability like other semiconductors . 25,26 The absorption performances of perovskite solar cell strongly rely on the crystallinity and stress state of the perovskite layer, and the mechanical properties of perovskite in the system are important for practical applications . 27 To understand the mechanical properties of pervoskite thin absorber solar cell subject to different B2+, X− species, and organic cations ,28 and to guide the applications of such as absorber inplanar-heterojunction solar cells fabricated on flexible polymer substrates ,29 first-principles calculations are necessary as the mechanical properties of CH3NH3BX3 (B = Sn, Pb; X = Br, I) are difficult to measure experimentally. In this report, we have investigated the elastic properties and anisotropy of the methylammonium tin/lead halide compounds first by first-principles calculations. Our findings shed light on screening demanded properties for practical devices, obtaining the key properties hard to acquire experimentally and elucidating their functionalities in photovoltaic. All first-principles calculations based on density of functional theory (DFT)30 are conducted using the plane wave basis in Cambridge Sequential Total Energy Package (CASTEP, v7.0) code. The dispersion interactions were calculated directly from an empirical pair-wise corrections proposed by Grimme 32 in terms of DFT+D2 scheme in this work, which is show more accurate results than classical DFT. The exchange-correlation functional of DFT was used by Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (PBE-GGA). The normal-conserving type pesudopotentials (NCPPs)35 within the frozen core approximation were employed, i.e. H 1s1, C 2s22p2, N 2s22p3, I 5s2 5p5, Br 4s24p5, Sn 5s25p2, and Pb 6s26p2. Here, the scalar-relativistic effects have been included in the construction of standard Pb NCPPs. The remaining non-relativistic effect turns on the spin-orbital coupling interaction which is beyond the capability of any plane wave code using NCPPs. Therefore, the spin-orbital coupling induced mass splitting of carriers (holes or electrons) near the band extremes is completely neglected. Moreover, the accurate electronic structures including band gap calculation have tiny effect in elastic properties calculation. The Monkhorst-Pack type k point used in our calculations is 10 × 10 × 10, 10 × 8 × 10, and 8 × 8 × 10 for pseudocubic, orthorhombic, and tetragonal phases, respectively. The kinetic energy cutoff is set to 900 eV. Figure 1 shows the pseudocubic (c), tetragonal (t), and orthorhombic (o) crystals structures of CH3NH3BX3 (B = Sn, Pb; X = Br, I) compounds, respectively. The calculated and experimental lattice 12–15,37,38 parameters of CH3NH3BX3 are tabulated in Table I. The crystal structures of different phase of CH3NH3BX3 compounds are constructed based on the methods reported in Refs. 12–15 and 37. The previous research shows the basic building block of the organic-inorganic perovskites is the ABX3 structure, where A is commonly a large cation coordinated to 12 X−anions. The structure consists of a network of corner-sharing BX6 octahedra, where the B atom is a metal cation (tin or lead) and X is the hybrid anion (bromine or iodine). The hinged octahedral allow for wide adjustment of the B-X-B bond angle, and several sets of cooperative rotations, known as tilt transitions, promote symmetry, which shows different structures at different temperatures. Experimentally, the organic-inorganic superlattices are easily obtained by altering the combination of the organic and inorganic components in the starting solution from which the hybrids are crystallized. Therefore, the dimensionality can be used as a further degree of freedom for tuning the material properties and different disordered structure appeared at different temperatures. For example, three phases exist in CH3NH3BX3 compound, with pseudocubic at high temperature, tetragonal at medium temperature, and orthorhombic at low temperature, respectively. Moreover, the complex structure defected and disordered CH3NH3+ ion lead to the phase boundary unclear using different fabrication methods. From Table I, it can be seen that the calculated lattice parameters by empirical pair-wise corrections in terms of DFT+D2 scheme are in good agreement with experimental values. This standard DFT calculation is shown to provide the geometrical structures and relative stabilities for this type of perovskites structure materials. In CH3NH3BX3 (B = Sn, Pb; X = Br, I) compounds, the effect of orbital hybridization in ABX3 perovskite is to drive the B2+ ion off the octahedral center, resulting in alternative long and short B-X bonds in the basal plane that leads to a variety of exotic functionalities. Although the organic ions are important in photonic absorption and energy conversion, the electronic structure and interaction among organic and inorganic ions would have negligible effect for elastic properties . 36 The mechanical properties of CH3NH3BX3 (B = Sn, Pb; X = Br, I) compounds are important in the analysis of the strain, stress, fracture mechanics, and deformation of solid absorber layers in application. We have investigated them by the stress-strain method based on the first-principles calculations. The elastic constants cij can be obtained by calculating the total energy as a function of appropriate lattice deformation. The elastic strain energy is as following: \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}\begin{equation} U = \Delta E/V_0 = \frac{1}{2}\sum\nolimits_i^6 {\sum\nolimits_j^6 {c_{ij} e_i e_j } }, \end{equation}\end{document}U=ΔE/V0=12∑i6∑j6cijeiej,where ΔE is the difference of energy; V0 is the volume of the original cell. The calculated independent elastic constants of pseudocubic, tetragonal, and orthorhombic phase of CH3NH3BX3 (B = Sn, Pb; X = Br, I) compounds are tabulated in Table II. For only the intrinsic elastic constants tabled in Table II, the calculation use the space group P1 for low symmetry of the pseudocubic and tetragonal. The elastic stabilities of the hybrid halide perovskites CH3NH3BX3 compounds have been estimated by the following stability criteria: c11 > 0; c44 > 0; c11 > c12; c11 + 2c12 > 0 for cubic crystals; c11 > 0, c33 > 0, c44 > 0, c66 > 0, c11 − c2 > 0, c11 + c33 − 2c13 > 0, 2c11 + c33 + 2c12 + 4c13 > 0 for tetragonal crystals; c11 > 0, c22 > 0, c33 > 0, c44 > 0, c55 > 0, c66 > 0, c11 + c22 − 2c12 > 0, c11 + c33 − 2c13 > 0, c22 + c33 − 2c23 > 0, c11 + c22 + c33 + 2c12 + 2c13 + 2c23 > 0 for orthorhombic crystals.From Table II, it can be seen that the calculated results of these hybrid halide perovskites satisfy the elastic stability conditions. c11, c22, and c33 represent the uniaxial deformation along the [0 0 1], [010], and [001] direction, respectively. c44, c55, and c66 are pure shear deformation on (1 0 0), (010), and (001) crystal plane, respectively. c12 is a mixture of σ11 and σ22 (or the pure shear stress at (1 1 0) crystal plane along $[1\bar 10]$[11¯0] direction) and so on. According to the calculated elastic constants, the bulk modulus (B), shear modulus (G), Young's modulus (E), and Poisson's ratio (τ) of polycrystalline forms are evaluated by Voigt–Reuss–Hill (VRH) approximation as tabled in Table III. The sound velocities and Debye temperature (ΘD) in the crystal are closely hinged to the elastic properties as the following definitions: \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}\begin{equation} \Theta _{\rm D} = \frac{h}{k}\left[ {\frac{{3n}}{{4\pi }}\left( {\frac{{N_A \rho }}{M}} \right)} \right]^{1/3} v_m, \end{equation}\end{document}ΘD=hk3n4πNAρM1/3vm,\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}\begin{equation} v_m = \left[ {\frac{1}{3}\left( {\frac{2}{{v_l^3 }} + \frac{1}{{v_t^3 }}} \right)} \right]^{ - \frac{1}{3}}, \end{equation}\end{document}vm=132vl3+1vt3−13,\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}\begin{equation} \left\{ \begin{array}{l} v_{l } = \sqrt {(B + \frac{4}{3}G)/\rho } \\[4pt] v_t = \sqrt {G/\rho } \\ \end{array} \right., \end{equation}\end{document}vl=(B+43G)/ρvt=G/ρ,where, h and k are Planck and Boltzmann constant, respectively; NA is the Avogadro's number, n is the number of atoms in the molecule, M is the molecular weight, and ρ is the density. B and G are isothermal bulk and shear moduli, respectively. The transverse (vt), longitudinal (vl), average (vm) sound velocities, and Debye temperature are shown in Table III. In order to discuss the anisotropy of chemical bonds and mechanical properties, the universal anisotropic index (AU),39 percent anisotropy (AB and AG) and shear anisotropic factors (A1 and A2) have been proposed as following:36 \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}\begin{equation} {\rm A}^U = 5\frac{{G_V }}{{G_R }} + \frac{{B_V }}{{B_R }} - 6 \ge 0, \end{equation}\end{document}AU=5GVGR+BVBR−6≥0,\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}\begin{equation} \left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}c} {A_B = \displaystyle\frac{{B_V - B_R }}{{B_V + B_R }}} \\[10pt] {A_G = \displaystyle\frac{{G_V - G_R }}{{G_V + G_R }}} \\ \end{array}} \right., \end{equation}\end{document}AB=BV−BRBV+BRAG=GV−GRGV+GR,\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}\begin{equation} A_1 = \frac{{4c_{44} }}{{c_{11} + c_{33} - 2c_{13} }}, \end{equation}\end{document}A1=4c44c11+c33−2c13,\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}\begin{equation} A_2 = \frac{{4c_{55} }}{{c_{22} + c_{33} - 2c_{23} }}, \end{equation}\end{document}A2=4c55c22+c33−2c23,\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}\begin{equation} A_3 = \frac{{4c_{66} }}{{c_{11} + c_{22} - 2c_{12} }}, \end{equation}\end{document}A3=4c66c11+c22−2c12,where, BV, BR, GV, and GR are the bulk and shear moduli calculated by Voigt and Reuss approximations, respectively. For isotropic structures the indexes in AU, AB AG, A1, and A2 are all zero. Deviations from zero indicate anisotropy. The calculated results are shown in Table IV. To better describe the elastic anisotropic behavior of different crystals, we have constructed the three-dimensional (3D) surface image depicted in Fig. 2. The directional dependences of the reciprocal of Young's modulus for various symmetry crystal structure in the 3D figures can be defined by the following equations: \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}\begin{equation} S_{1111} = \sum\nolimits_{n = 1}^3 {\sum\nolimits_{m = 1}^3 {\sum\nolimits_{p = 1}^3 {\sum\nolimits_{q = 1}^3 {S_{nmpq}\, l_{1n} l_{1m} l_{1p} l_{1q} } } } }, \end{equation}\end{document}S1111=∑n=13∑m=13∑p=13∑q=13Snmpql1nl1ml1pl1q,where, S1111 is 1/E, and Snmpq are the elastic compliance matrix; l1n, l1m, l1p, and l1q are the directional cosines of the new x axis (or [100] direction) in the transformed Cartesian coordinate system with respect to the original coordinates. The surface contours of the Young's modulus of iodides perovskite-type compounds discussed here are illustrated in Fig. 2 in a 3D space. For the hybrid halide perovskites compounds, the most calculated c11 is the largest elastic constant among these independent parameters. Moreover, it is well known that the low elastic constant c44 implies a weak resistance to shear in the (100) plane. Compared with the elastic properties of perovskite polycrystalline, the bulk modulus ranges from 12 to 30 GPa, the shear modulus ranges from 3 to 12 GPa and Young's modulus ranges from 15 to 37 GPa. When comparing these values, we found several evidences as following: (1) the moduli of bromide are larger than iodide for the similar crystal structure and composition; (2) the moduli of tin-based compounds are larger than lead-based compounds for the similar crystal structure and composition; (3) the effect of phases on the elastic moduli is not clear. We suspect the different radii and electronegativity of B2+ and X− ion may lead to above observations listed in (1) and (2). The ionic radius of Sn2+, Pb2+, Br−, and I− is 0.81 Å, 1.29 Å, 1.96 Å, and 0.95Å, respectively. The electronegativity of them is 1.8, 1.9, 2.8, and 2.5, respectively. The length and strength of chemical bond of Sn-Br, Sn-I, Pb-Br, and Pb-I are different among each crystal symmetry. Debye temperature represents the strength of the average chemical bond as shown in Table III. It can be see the Debye temperature of these perovskite compounds ranges from 140 to 170 K, respectively. The values are much lower than most of inorganic compounds and close to the stronger organic compounds. The similar argument applies to sound velocity. In sum, the elastic properties are dependent on the building element of B2+ and X− ion. Furthermore, the critical value 1.75 has been used extensively to index the ductility of a material. In these perovskite cases, the values of B/G for them are larger than the critical value. For orthorhombic structures, B/G values are much larger than 2.0, which show that they would have a deformation and remain the properties subject to bending, tensile and compression. Therefore, the conclusion that one could draw from the large B/G ratio can be used in fabricating thin film absorber layer working at room temperature for large scale deformation purpose. The main reason is attributed to the low shear modulus of perovskites. Poisson's ratio τ referring to a ductile solid is usually with large τ (>0.26). The Poisson's ratio is larger than 0.3 for these perovskite compounds. Generally, the larger the Poisson's ratio is, the softer the material is. For example, rubber's τ is 0.50, gold 0.42, copper 0.33, aluminum alloy 0.33, steel 0. 27–0.30, and glass 0. 18–0.30. For ionic or covalent-ionic crystals, their Poisson's ratios are usually located between 0.2 and 0.25. But for the hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite compounds, it is more like a molecular crystal and it would have a good ductile ability as a flexible layer on the polymer substrate. The reason should be the weak chemical bonds in the perovskite compounds dependent on the constructed elements. Due to the “soft characters” of these perovskites, the band gap of them can be tunable easily carried by strain engineering in application. The anisotropy of elastic properties is an important topic from the view of applications. For the different symmetry of the crystal, it has different impacts on the anisotropic properties of the CH3NH3BX3 (B = Sn, Pb; X = Br, I) compounds. The anisotropy of crystal can be studied from the independent elastic constants by evaluating the anisotropic factors or indexes. To describe these properties, the AU, AB AG, A1, A2, and A3 are listed in the Table IV. The universal anisotropic index (AU) is a better indicator than other indices, which can provide unique and consistent results for the elastic anisotropy of perovskite compounds. Due to the smaller C44 with the related low shear parameters, the universal indexes Au of bromide and iodide compounds is up to 3.68 and 5.39, respectively. The elastic moduli and Au of these compounds vary largely along different orientations, and the calculated AG, A1, A2, and A3 values support this conclusion. Though AG, A1, A2, and A3 determine the anisotropy of the shear modulus, the values of A1, A2, and A3 are quite different from AG. It seems that the very strong anisotropy of these perovskites is unstable at ambient condition except some stabilizing factors like lots of vibrations at higher temperature or doped other elements are introduced. The anisotropy of Young's modulus was presented by plotting its three dimensional (3D) surface contour for each perovskite compounds. From Fig. 2, it can be seen that CH3NH3BX3 compounds show a strong anisotropic properties. Owing to the lower c44 than c11, the contours of Young's modulus of perovskite compounds are highly distorted along the [001] direction. The calculated planar contours of Young's modulus at the (010) and (110) crystallographic planes exhibit strong anisotropic properties too. The maxima of Young's modulus for all CH3NH3BX3 structures are determined by their principal axes. The rules for different constructed element are similar as the previous discussion. By using the first-principles calculations based on DFT, the equilibrium lattice parameters, elastic and anisotropic properties of CH3NH3BX3 (B = Sn, Pb; X = Br, I) compounds as a solar absorber layer are investigated. The results show that the type and strength of chemical bond B-X determine the elastic properties, and the interaction among organic and inorganic ions would have negligible effect for elastic properties. The bulk, shear, Young's modulus ranges from 12 to 30 GPa, 3 to 12 GPa, and 15 to 37 GPa, respectively. We found that the moduli of bromide are larger than iodide; the moduli of tin compounds are larger than lead compounds; and the effect of phases on the elastic moduli is not clear. We believe the different electronic properties, radii, and electronegativity of B2+ and X− ion are essential to lead to such observations. The B/G and Poisson's ratio demonstrate that such perovskites layer can be used in compliant devices with very large deformation demanded. The main reason was attributed to the low shear modulus. The anisotropic indexes AU, AB AG, A1, A2, and A3 show ABX3 perovskite indicate very strong anisotropy. The results show these perovskite compounds could be used in flexible polymer substrates due to the “soft characters” and the band gap of them can be tunable easily carried by strain engineering in application. The calculated results can be used to guide future experimental works on the hybrid halide perovskites as potentially high-performance solar cell absorber.
