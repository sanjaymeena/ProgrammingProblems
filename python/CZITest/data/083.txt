We have succeeded in fabricating Li-intercalated bilayer graphene on silicon carbide. The low-energy electron diffraction from Li-deposited bilayer graphene shows a sharp \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\sqrt{3}$\end{document}3×\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\sqrt{3}$\end{document}3\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\it R$\end{document}R30° pattern in contrast to Li-deposited monolayer graphene. This indicates that Li atoms are intercalated between two adjacent graphene layers and take the same well-ordered superstructure as in bulk C6Li. The angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy has revealed that Li atoms are fully ionized and the π bands of graphene are systematically folded by the superstructure of intercalated Li atoms, producing a snowflake-like Fermi surface centered at the Γ point. The present result suggests a high potential of Li-intercalated bilayer graphene for application to a nano-scale Li-ion battery.
Intercalation of atoms or molecules into layered materials provides very rich electrical and chemical properties which are distinctly different from those of pristine materials. In particular, intercalation into bulk graphite has attracted special attentions, since graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) show various fascinating physical properties such as the superconductivity and the magnetism. GICs also have a high potential for technological application like chemical catalysis and storage of intercalants . 1 In fact, lithium(Li)-intercalated graphite (Li-GIC) has been widely used as an anode material in the rechargeable battery. Fabrication of bulk Li-GIC and its electric structure have been intensively studied experimentally 6–9 and theoretically, 10–13 while it is unclear whether the intercalation of Li atoms is possible in the thinnest limit, namely in bilayer graphene. Fabrication of Li-intercalated bilayer graphene is not only challenging but also very important for developing a new nano-scale-thickness ion battery with a high charge/discharge rate. In this paper, we report the fabrication of Li-intercalated bilayer graphene on a SiC(0001) substrate. We have characterized the crystallographic and electronic properties by low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). In the ARPES experiments, we found the folding of energy bands corresponding to the \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\sqrt{3}$\end{document}3×\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\sqrt{3}$\end{document}3\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\it R$\end{document}R30° superstructure observed by LEED, together with the energy shift of the π and π* bands toward the high-binding energy indicative of the electron doping from Li atoms to graphene sheets.
Graphene films were prepared by annealing a \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\it n$\end{document}n-type Si-rich 6\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\it H$\end{document}H-SiC(0001) single crystal with resistive heating under 0.1MPa Ar gas.14 By controlling the heating temperature and time, we selectively synthesized monolayer or bilayer graphene. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement confirmed the typical terrace size of ∼5 μm. Deposition of lithium was carried out using a lithium dispenser (SAES Getters) in a vacuum of 5.0 × 10−10 Torr. ARPES measurements were performed using a VG-SCIENTA SES2002 spectrometer with a high-flux helium discharge lamp and a toroidal grating monochromator. We used the He IIα (40.814 eV) resonance line to excite photoelectrons. The energy and angular resolutions were set at 16 meV and 0.2°, respectively.
Figures 1(a) and 1(b) show the LEED patterns of monolayer and bilayer graphene, respectively. The LEED pattern is quite similar between monolayer and bilayer graphene, and consists of basically three types of spots; (i) the (1×1) spot from the bulk SiC substrate (Si(1×1)),15 (ii) the weak 6\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\sqrt{3}$\end{document}3×6\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\sqrt{3}$\end{document}3\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\it R$\end{document}R30° spot due to the buffer layer, 15–17 and (iii) the C(1×1) spot from the honeycomb atomic pattern of graphene. We find that the intensity of the C(1×1) spot in bilayer graphene is stronger than that of monolayer counterpart. When we deposit Li atoms onto these graphene films, the LEED patterns show discernible differences between monolayer and bilayer graphene, as shown in Figs. 1(c) and 1(d). In monolayer graphene, the intensity of C(1×1) and 6\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\sqrt{3}$\end{document}3×6\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\sqrt{3}$\end{document}3\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\it R$\end{document}R30° spots is significantly reduced upon Li deposition, while the Si(1×1) spot remains clearly visible. On the other hand, in bilayer graphene, the Li deposition weakens the intensity of the 6\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\sqrt{3}$\end{document}3×6\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\sqrt{3}$\end{document}3\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\it R$\end{document}R30° spot, and produces new superlattice spots with the periodicity of \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\sqrt{3}$\end{document}3×\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\sqrt{3}$\end{document}3\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\it R$\end{document}R30°, as seen in Fig. 1(d). This superlattice structure was found to be stable for a few days under vacuum at room temperature despite the highly reactive nature of Li atoms. Since the observed \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\sqrt{3}$\end{document}3×\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\sqrt{3}$\end{document}3\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\it R$\end{document}R30° periodicity is identical to that of bulk C6Li,1 it is quite likely that Li atoms are intercalated between adjacent graphene layers as shown in Figs. 1(e) and 1(f). The observed reduction of 6\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\sqrt{3}$\end{document}3×6\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\sqrt{3}$\end{document}3\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\it R$\end{document}R30° LEED intensity upon the Li deposition is well understood in terms of the expansion of the distance between two adjacent graphene layers by the Li intercalation. Figure 2(a) shows valence-band ARPES spectra of Li-intercalated bilayer graphene (C6LiC6) measured along the Γ-K-M high-symmetry line in the Brillouin zone (BZ) of graphene at 30 K. We clearly find several dispersive bands. One band has the bottom of dispersion at ∼10 eV at the Γ point, dispersing toward Fermi level (\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\it E$\end{document}EF) on approaching the K point where a sharp quasiparticle peak is clearly seen. Another band has the top of dispersion at ∼5 eV at the Γ point and exhibits a strong downward dispersion toward the K point. The electronic structure of C6LiC6 looks quite similar to that of C6X (X = Li, Ca, La, Eu, and Yb),1,6,8,9,15, 18–20 although the weak intensity near the Γ point is not observed in pristine graphene or graphite. In order to see more clearly these dispersive features in the ARPES spectra, we have mapped out the band structure and show the result in Fig. 2(b). The experimental band structure was obtained by taking the second derivative of ARPES spectra and plotted it as a function of wave vector and binding energy. The band with the bottom at ∼10 eV at the Γ point is assigned to the π band, while the band with the top at ∼5 eV at the Γ point is the σ band. All these spectral features are basically identical to those of pristine bilayer graphene shown in Fig. 2(c), while we clearly identify additional bands around the Γ point which resemble the π band around the K point. These additional bands around the Γ point are likely assigned to the π bands folded by the periodic potential of intercalated Li atoms, but is hard to be explained in terms of the metallic free-electron-like Li 2\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\it s$\end{document}s or interlayer band ,10,11,13 because (i) these bands do not show a parabolic-like energy dispersion and (ii) the Fermi-surface (FS) shape is well explained by the band folding as shown in the next section. It is noted that band dispersion in the valence-band region of pristine bilayer and monolayer graphene is quite similar, while a clear difference is seen near \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\it E$\end{document}EF. As shown in Figs. 2(d) and 2(e), the number of observed bands is obviously different between monolayer and bilayer graphene (single \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\it vs$\end{document}vs. double), enabling us to distinguish monolayer and bilayer graphene as starting substrate. As shown in Figs. 2(e) and 2(f), a detailed comparison of the near-\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\it E$\end{document}EF band dispersion around the K point between pristine bilayer graphene and C6LiC6 further reveals some quantitative differences in the character of π* bands. The Dirac energy (\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\it E$\end{document}ED), which is defined as the midpoint of the top of the π band and the bottom of the π* band, is shifted by 1.4 eV toward the high binding energy in C6LiC6 compared with pristine bilayer graphene. This band shift is consistent with the previous theoretical and experimental studies of Li-GIC,7,10,13 and is explained in terms of the shift of the chemical potential due to the charge transfer from Li atoms. We also find in Figs. 2(e) and 2(f) that there exists a band gap of ∼0.12 eV in pristine bilayer graphene possibly due to a finite interaction with the SiC substrate ,21 and it appears to be enhanced to ∼0.5 eV in C6LiC6. To elucidate the band-folding effect on the near-\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\it E$\end{document}EF electronic states, we plotted in Fig. 3 the ARPES intensity of (a) pristine bilayer graphene and (b) C6LiC6 at \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\it E$\end{document}EF as a function of two-dimensional wave vector. It is apparent that the observed Fermi-surface topology of C6LiC6 is drastically different from that of pristine bilayer graphene. In C6LiC6, we observe two types of FSs at the K point of the graphene BZ; the S1 FS has a closed triangular shape surrounding the K point, and the S2 FS is bigger than the S1 FS and extends toward the M point of the graphene BZ. We also find additional weak features S3 and S4 in Fig. 3(b): S3 extends toward the Γ point from the K point of the graphene BZ while S4 is centered at the Γ point, showing a snowflake-like shape. We think that the S3 and S4 FSs are replicas of the S1 and S2 FSs produced by the band folding due to the superstructure of intercalated Li atoms. In fact, when we fold the S1 and S2 FSs by following the reconstructed BZ scheme (solid lines in Fig. 3(b)), the newly created FS at the Γ point (Fig. 3(c)) shows a good agreement with the experimental FS in Fig. 3(b). We have estimated the electron carrier concentration in graphene sheet from the area of FS in the first BZ as shown in Fig. 3(c). The measured FS area gives 1.07 ± 0.05 electrons per two graphene sheets. This indicates that Li atoms sandwiched by two graphene sheets are fully ionized (Li+) and the observed snowflake shaped FS is due to the folded π* band. Moreover, this FS volume is a half of the theoretically-predicted FS volume of C6CaC6,22 consistent with the valency difference between Ca2 + to Li+. All these experimental results indicated that Li atoms are intercalated into the thinnest graphite, bilayer graphene, in a well-ordered manner as in bulk GIC. The successful intercalation of Li atoms into bilayer graphene provides an important step to the new device technology like ion battery. Although graphite has been long used as an anode material in Li ion battery, it involves inherent difficulties such as the long charging time and the large volume change upon the charge/discharge cycle. Recently, several proposals have been made with the nano-scale materials such as Si alloy/nanowire and transition metal oxides to overcome the above-mentioned difficulties and achieve the higher charge/discharge rate with far less volume change. Li-intercalated bilayer graphene would be a good candidate for developing such a new nano-scale ion battery.
In summary, we reported the fabrication and characterization of Li-intercalated bilayer graphene. The LEED and ARPES measurements show that Li atoms deposited onto bilayer graphene are fully ionized and take the same \documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\sqrt{3}$\end{document}3×\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\sqrt{3}$\end{document}3\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\begin{document}$\it R$\end{document}R30° superstructure as in bulk C6Li. This indicates that Li atoms deposited onto bilayer graphene are intercalated between two adjacent graphene layers in the same well-ordered manner as in bulk C6Li. This success of fabrication of Li-intercalated bilayer graphene would open a way to developing a nano-scale ion battery.
